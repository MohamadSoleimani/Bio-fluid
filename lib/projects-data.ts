    longDescription:
      "In this research, we present a novel omega-shaped microfluidic device designed for the passive separation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples. The separation of CTCs is critical for understanding cancer progression and enhancing early diagnosis, as these cells play a pivotal role in metastasis and disease spread. Traditional methods for CTC separation can be categorized into active and passive techniques. Active methods employ external forces such as electrical, magnetic, acoustic, and optical forces, while passive methods rely on channel geometry and fluid dynamics to achieve separation. Passive separation is particularly appealing for its simplicity and potential for miniaturization, making it suitable for lab-on-a-chip applications.",

    longDescription:"In this study, the PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Network) methodology is used to create steady-state surrogate models for incompressible laminar flow with heat transfer in a 2D internal domain that includes obstructions. These obstructions, which are circular cylinders, are used to enhance heat transfer in the channel. Automatic spatial and temporal differentiation is applied to the partial differential equations governing mass momentum and energy conservation, with the residuals included in the loss function along with the boundary and initial conditions. The results show a good match between the PINN and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations for both steady-state and transient scenarios, but normalizing the PDEs is essential.",
